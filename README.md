# cell-shader
A kmeans image compressor that yields a cell-shading-esque effect

Command line args as follows: path to input image, path to output image, k value, p value(for minkowski distance metric - 1 is manhattan, 2 euclidean, 20+ chebyshev), and # of iterations.

There are some "before and after" examples in the resources and output folders.
